## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles
- [React-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)

### What I learned

- started learning React Redux library and used it for managing state of the cart (number of items in it)
- learned how to use inline-svg and style it in css (how to change color on hover)
- react-use library: useMedia, useClickAway

### Continued development

I'm going to continue focusing on Redux learning in future projects. I've just started using it and it was not easy. I feel like i need to practice more.
